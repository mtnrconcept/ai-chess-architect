# Lovable API Key Cleanup Report

The project no longer depends on `LOVABLE_API_KEY`. The following files were updated to remove the secret requirement and associated code paths:

| File | Change summary |
| --- | --- |
| `supabase/functions/_shared/env.ts` | Removed Lovable gateway configuration helpers and the `getLovableApiKey` export. |
| `supabase/functions/generate-chess-rule/index.ts` | Replaced Lovable chat completions call with a deterministic rule generator that does not require external secrets. |
| `supabase/functions/chess-insights/index.ts` | Simplified to an offline heuristic analysis, eliminating Lovable gateway usage. |
| `src/integrations/supabase/errors.ts` | Removed Lovable-specific error normalisation branches. |
| `README.md` | Deleted instructions about provisioning `LOVABLE_API_KEY` and added Lovable Cloud-native setup notes. |

All remaining Edge Functions rely solely on Supabase-managed secrets (`SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`).
