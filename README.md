If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

## Local configuration

Some serverless features depend on the Lovable AI gateway. Both edge functions under `supabase/functions` require the `LOVABLE_API_KEY` secret to be present in the Supabase project so that they can authenticate against the gateway.

### Supabase & Lovable AI integration

This repository already ships with the Supabase configuration generated by Lovable AI. All database tables, types, and edge
functions live under the `supabase/` directory and are wired to the same Lovable AI gateway that powers the in-app chatbot.

- **Reuse the provided project** – keep using the Supabase project ID and anon key from the existing `.env` file so the web
  client and serverless functions continue to point to the Lovable-managed instance.
- **Deploy edge functions from this folder** – when you push updates to `supabase/functions/*`, redeploy them with the
  Supabase CLI to ensure the Lovable AI gateway secret is picked up.
- **Migrations are tracked here** – any schema change should be captured with `npx supabase migration new` so the Lovable AI
  workspace and this repo stay in sync.

By keeping the same Supabase folder and Lovable API configuration, the chatbot and tournament features stay connected to the
shared Lovable AI services without additional setup.

Set the secret with the Supabase CLI from the root of the repository (replace `sk_live_xxx` with your real key):

```sh
npx supabase secrets set LOVABLE_API_KEY=sk_live_xxx
```

If you do not use the CLI, the secret can also be configured from the Supabase dashboard by navigating to **Project Settings → API → Secrets** and adding a new entry named `LOVABLE_API_KEY`.

Whenever the secret is updated, redeploy the edge functions so they pick up the latest value:

```sh
npx supabase functions deploy generate-chess-rule chess-insights
```
