# Supabase Operations Report

## Overview

Attempts were made to provision the database schema, deploy the Supabase Edge Functions, and validate the Lovable AI gateway model. The operations could not be completed because the required Supabase access token and Lovable API key were not available in the environment.

## Database Migrations

The command `npx supabase db push --project-ref ucaqbhmyutlnitnedowk` was executed to apply the migrations for project `ucaqbhmyutlnitnedowk`. The CLI returned an "unknown flag" error for `--project-ref`. Pushing without linking the project requires authentication, which is not possible without the Supabase access token.

## Edge Function Deployment

Attempting to list Supabase projects with `npx supabase projects list` confirmed that the CLI needs an access token (`supabase login` or the `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable). Because the token is absent, deploying functions via `npx supabase functions deploy ...` would also fail.

## Lovable AI Model Verification

The Edge Functions depend on the `LOVABLE_API_KEY` secret to call the Lovable AI gateway. The key is not present in the environment, so no verification calls to `https://ai.gateway.lovable.dev/v1/chat/completions` could be executed.

## Next Steps

1. Obtain a Supabase access token associated with the project `ucaqbhmyutlnitnedowk` and run `supabase login` (or export `SUPABASE_ACCESS_TOKEN`).
2. Link the local project to the remote instance using `npx supabase link --project-ref ucaqbhmyutlnitnedowk`.
3. Rerun `npx supabase db push` to apply migrations, followed by `npx supabase functions deploy generate-chess-rule chess-insights report-tournament-match sync-tournaments tournament-matchmaking`.
4. Set the Lovable API key via `npx supabase secrets set LOVABLE_API_KEY=...` and re-deploy the functions so that they can authenticate against the Lovable AI gateway.
5. After the secret is configured, send a test request to the deployed `generate-chess-rule` or `chess-insights` function to confirm the Lovable AI responses.
